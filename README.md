This project outlines a secure and innovative approach to password entry using an RFID-enabled Arduino setup. The objective is to maintain confidentiality while entering passwords in public or insecure environments. Here's a detailed overview:

- **🔧 Components:**
  - Arduino Microcontroller
  - RFID Reader Module
  - Computer with USB interface


- **⚙️ Functionality:**
  - Upon scanning a registered RFID card, the Arduino acts as a secondary keyboard.
  - The Arduino is programmed to simulate keyboard input, automatically entering a pre-saved password.
  - Custom keyboard mapping is stored in the Arduino’s firmware, ensuring seamless communication with the computer.

- **🔒 Security Considerations:**
  - Integrating RFID technology ensures sensitive password data remains secure, preventing eavesdropping or shoulder surfing attacks.
  - The password is input only when the authorized RFID card is detected.

- **🛠️ Setup and Configuration:**
  - The Arduino connects to the computer via USB, with the appropriate drivers installed.
  - The RFID module is configured and linked to the Arduino, ensuring seamless communication.
  - Custom firmware is uploaded to the Arduino to map keys and automate password entry.

This project offers a practical solution for secure password entry in public settings, leveraging RFID and Arduino technologies to provide a robust and user-friendly interface.
